Using the transfer factor \RZll, the total estimated event yield \Tll\ in each dilepton control region in the $i^\mathrm{th}$ bin of the \ETg\ distribution can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \Tll[,i] = \frac{\NZg[i]}{\RZll[,i]} + b_{\ell\ell\Pgg,i},
\end{equation}
where \NZg\ is the number of \zinvg\ events in the combined signal regions and $b_{\ell\ell\Pgg}$ is the predicted contribution from other background sources in the dilepton control region, namely \ttg, VV\Pgg, and misidentified hadrons. 
The subscript $i$ indicates that the quantities are evaluated in bin $i$ of the \ETg distribution.

Using \RWl\ and \fZW, the total estimated event yield \Tl\ in each single-lepton control region in the $i$th bin of the \ETg\ distribution can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \Tl[,i] = \frac{\NZg[i]}{\RWl[,i]\fZW[,i]} + b_{\ell\Pgg,i},
\end{equation}
where $b_{\ell\Pgg}$ is the predicted contribution from other background sources in the single-lepton regions, namely misidentified electrons and hadrons and other minor SM processes.
