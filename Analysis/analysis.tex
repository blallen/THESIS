Using the transfer factor \RZll, the total estimated event yield \Tll\ in each dilepton control region in the $i^\mathrm{th}$ bin of the \ETg\ distribution can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \Tll[,i] = \frac{\NZg[i]}{\RZll[,i]} + b_{\ell\ell\Pgg,i},
\end{equation}
where \NZg\ is the number of \zinvg\ events in the combined signal regions and $b_{\ell\ell\Pgg}$ is the predicted contribution from other background sources in the dilepton control region, namely \ttg, VV\Pgg, and misidentified hadrons. 
The subscript $i$ indicates that the quantities are evaluated in bin $i$ of the \ETg\ distribution.

    }
    \label{fig:tf_wz}
\end{figure}

Using \RWl\ and \fZW, the total estimated event yield \Tl\ in each single-lepton control region in the $i^\mathrm{th}$ bin of the \ETg\ distribution can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \Tl[,i] = \frac{\NZg[i]}{\RWl[,i]\fZW[,i]} + b_{\ell\Pgg,i},
\end{equation}
where $b_{\ell\Pgg}$ is the predicted contribution from other background sources in the single-lepton regions, namely misidentified electrons and hadrons and other minor SM processes.

    The uncertainty due to \Pgg-induced production is negligible in \zinvg\ production.
  }
  \label{fig:ewk_correction}
\end{figure}

We apply the correction factors shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ewk_correction}, which are combinations of Sudakov suppression factors and photon-induced enhancements, and are provided by the authors of Ref.~\cite{Denner:2015fca} in addition to the NNLO QCD correction.

Figure~\ref{fig:tf_syst} shows the effect of systematic uncertainty in the ratio between the \zinvg\ and \wlng\ processes with respect to nominal value for ${\PZ\Pgg}$ and ${\PW\Pgg}$ respectively.

\section{Misidentified electrons}
\label{sec:efake}

Figure~\ref{fig:efake_fits} shows the six fits performed on \Pe\Pe\ and \Pe\Pgg\ in bins of probe $\pt$, from which the $R_{\Pe}$ factor used for the estimation of the electron misidentification background is derived. 
The $R_{\Pe}$ factor is computed as the ratio of the integral of the signal template function between 81\GeV and 101\GeV.

\section{Misidentified hadrons}
\label{sec:hfake}

The estimation of hadron misidentification background proceeds in multiple steps. 
First, the fraction of hadronic objects within a pool of photon candidate objects in the photon plus jet control region is measured. 
This measurement is described in detail in Section~\ref{subsec:pixelveto}.
Figure~\ref{fig:impurity-compsb} and Table~\ref{tab:hfake-impurity-systs} show the final impurity and associated uncertainties as a function of \pt. 

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \input{Analysis/Figures/hfake/table_impurity_barrel_medium-pixel-monoph.tex}
  \caption{Impurities for photons as a function of \pt.}
  \label{tab:hfake-impurity-systs}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{Analysis/Figures/hfake/plot_impurity_barrel_medium.pdf}
    \caption{
    Impurities for photons as a function of \pt. 
    The different bands show the effects of adding different stages of the full ID, starting with the baseline ID and isolation and successively adding the pixel seed veto.
  }
  \label{fig:impurity-compsb}
\end{figure}

Following this measurement, another control sample is formed where the photon in the photon plus jet sample is replaced by a hadronic proxy object. 
The hadronic proxy object is a reconstructed photon object which pass the photon ID described in Section~\ref{subsec:objects} with the execption of failing at least one of the following cuts: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\sieie < 0.01022$
\item PF Charged Hadron isolation $< 0.441$ GeV .
\end{itemize}
Additionally, we apply a $\met < 60$ GeV cut to make this region orthogonal to the signal region of the analysis.
  
The hadronic transfer factor $R_{h}$, which measures the rate at which hadronic proxy objects result in hadrons that are misidentified as candidate photons, is obtained by dividing the estimated number of misidentified hadrons in the photon plus jet sample by the number of events in the hadron proxy + jet control region as a function of \pt. 
Figure~\ref{fig:hadronTFactor} shows the transfer factor $R_{h}$ along with the various distributions used for its derivation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{Analysis/Figures/hfake/distributionsNom.pdf}

    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{Analysis/Figures/hfake/tfactorLoose.pdf}
    \caption{
      Left: The \pt\ distribution of the candidate photon object in the photon + jet control sample (black), the result of scaling it with the impurity (red), and the \pt\ distribution of the hadronic proxy object in the proxy + jet control sample (blue).
      Right: Hadronic transfer factor $R_{h}$, which is the ratio of the red and blue distributions in the left plot. 
      Top: Nominal hadron proxy object. 
      Middle: Tighter hadron proxy object. 
      Bottom: Looser hadron proxy object.
    }
    \label{fig:hadronTFactor}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Finally, a third control sample of events with a hadronic proxy object and $\met > 170$ GeV is prepared. 
Under the assumption that the $R_{h}$ stays constant regardless of whether the event has a high-\pt\ jet or \met, this proxy plus \met\ sample is then weighted by $R_{h}$ to arrive at an estimate of the misidentified hadron plus \met\ background of this analysis.

%%% need to update these numbers
To estimate the uncertainty on this background, we repeat the above method using tighter and looser definitions of the hadron proxy object.
The tighter definition differs from the nominal by the following cuts:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho$-corrected PF Neutral Hadron isolation $< 0.264 + 0.014 \times \pt^\gamma + 0.000019 \times \left( \pt^\gamma \right)^2$. 
\item $\rho$-corrected PF Photon isolation $< 2.362 + 0.0053 \times \pt^\gamma$,
\end{itemize}
and the looser definition differs from the nominal by the following cuts:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho$-corrected PF Neutral Hadron isolation $< 10.910 + 0.014 \times \pt^\gamma + 0.000019 \times \left( \pt^\gamma \right)^2$. 
\item $\rho$-corrected PF Photon isolation $< 3.630 + 0.0053 \times \pt^\gamma$.
\end{itemize}

The different distributions from the nominal, tight, and loose selections are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hadronFakeShapes}. 
The tight and loose shapes are taken as the one sigma band around the nominal estimate. 
Additionally, there is an uncertainty coming from the estimation of the photon purity. 
Figure~\ref{fig:hadronFakePurity} shows the resulting shapes from moving the shapes generated by a one sigma shift in the purity.

\section{Spikes}
\label{sec:spikes}

\section{Beam halo}
\label{sec:beam_halo}

Figure~\ref{fig:halophi} shows the $\phi$ distribution of the halo showers obtained from the single photon data set, requiring $\ETg > 175\GeV$ and $\met > 170\GeV$. 
Here, halo showers are defined as photon objects that fail the MIP total energy cut in events where beam halo MET filter (one component of the ``MET filters'' mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:selection}). 
The distribution is shifted and folded to make the peaking behavior clear. 
The resulting variable on the horizontal axis is named $\phi'$.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Analysis/Figures/haloPhiFolded.pdf}
    \caption{
      Folded $\phi'$ distribution of the halo sample.
    }
    \label{fig:halophi}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The splitting of the signal region can be thought of as a two-bin fit. 
Collision processes occupy the relative fractions of phase space in the horizontal ($H$) and vertical ($V$) signal regions, $C_{H} = 1/\pi$ and $C_{V} = (\pi-1)/\pi$, respectively. 
The corresponding fractions for beam halo events are determined by selecting a halo-enriched sample where the halo identification is inverted. 
Thus, a fit of the two signal regions provides an estimate of the overall normalization of the beam halo background, denoted $h$. 
The \ETg\ dependence of the halo background is encoded in \nhalo[,i], the unit-normalized beam halo prediction in the $i^\mathrm{th}$ bin of the signal region $K \in \{H,V\}$.
Using the notation introduced in Section~\ref{sec:irreducible}, the total estimated background \TK\ in the two signal regions are
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \TK[,i] & = C_{K} (\NZg[i] + \NWg[i]) + h \nhalo[,i] + C_{K} b_{K,i} \\
          & = C_{K} (1 + {\fZW[i]}^{-1}) \NZg[i] + h \nhalo[,i] + C_{K} b_{K,i},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $b_{K,i}$ is the total contribution to bin $i$ of region $K$ from electron and hadron misidentification, ECAL spikes, and other minor SM background processes.

\section{Other minor SM background processes}
\label{sec:minorsm}
The SM \ttg, VV\Pgg, \zllg, $\PW\to\ell\PGn$, and \gj\ processes are minor ($\sim$10\%) background processes in the signal region. 
Although \zllg\ and \gj\ do not involve high-\pt\ invisible particles, the former can exhibit large \met\ when the leptons fail to be reconstructed, and the latter when jet energy is severely mismeasured. 
The estimates for all five processes are taken from \MGvATNLO simulations at LO in QCD and can be found in Tables~\ref{tab:yield_mask_horizontal} and~\ref{tab:yield_mask_vertical}.

\section{Statistical Interpretation}
\label{sec:interpretation}

Free parameters of the fit are the yield of \zinvg\ background in each bin of the signal regions (\NZg[i]) and the overall normalization of the beam halo background ($h$). 
Bin-by-bin yields of \wlng\ and \zllg\ samples in all regions are related to the yield of \zinvg\ through the MC prediction through the transfer factors defined in Section~\ref{sec:irreducible}. 
The transfer factors are allowed to shift within the aforementioned theoretical and experimental uncertainties.

The background-only likelihood that is maximized in the fit is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \mathcal{L} & = \prod_{i} \left\{ \mathcal{L_{\text{signal}}} \times \mathcal{L_{\text{single-lepton}}} \times \mathcal{L_{\text{dilepton}}} \right\} \times \mathcal{L_{\text{nuisances}}} \\
  & = \prod_{i} \left\{
    \prod_{K=H,V} \mathcal{P}\left( d_{K, i} \left| \TK[,i] (\vec{\theta} \right.) \right) \times \prod_{\ell=\Pe,\Pgm} \mathcal{P}\left( d_{\ell\Pgg, i} \left| \Tl[,i] (\vec{\theta}) \right. \right)
    \times \prod_{\ell=\Pe,\Pgm} \mathcal{P}\left( d_{\ell\ell\Pgg, i} \left| \Tll[,i] (\vec{\theta}) \right. \right)
    \right\}  \times \prod_{j} \mathcal{N}(\theta_j) \\
  & = \prod_{i} \left\{
  \begin{gathered}
    \prod\limits_{K=H,V} \mathcal{P}\biggl( d_{K, i} \biggl| \left(1 + {\fZW[,i]}^{-1}(\vec{\theta})\right) C_{K} \NZg[i] + h \nhalo[,i](\vec{\theta}) + C_{K} b_{K, i}(\vec{\theta}) \biggr. \biggr) \\
    \times \prod\limits_{\ell=\Pe,\Pgm} \mathcal{P}\biggl( d_{\ell\Pgg, i} \biggl| \frac{\NZg[i]}{\RWl[,i](\vec{\theta}) \fZW[,i] (\vec{\theta})} + b_{\ell\Pgg, i}(\vec{\theta}) \biggr. \biggr) \\
    \times \prod\limits_{\ell=\Pe,\Pgm} \mathcal{P}\biggl( d_{\ell\ell\Pgg, i} \biggl| \frac{\NZg[i]}{\RZll[,i](\vec{\theta})} + b_{\ell\ell\Pgg, i}(\vec{\theta}) \biggr. \biggr)
  \end{gathered} \right\}
  \times \prod_{j} \mathcal{N}(\theta_j),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
following the notation introduced in Section~\ref{sec:irreducible}, and where $\mathcal{P}
(n\vert\lambda)$ is the Poisson probability of $n$ for mean $\lambda$, $\mathcal{N}$ denotes the unit normal distribution, and $d_{X,i}$ is the observed number of events in bin i of region X.
Systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters in the fit and are represented by
$\vec{\theta}$.
Each quantity $Q_{j}$ with a nominal value $\overline{Q}_{j}$ and a standard deviation of the systematic uncertainty $\sigma_{j}$ appears in the likelihood function as $\overline{Q}_{j}\exp(\sigma_{j}\theta_{j})$.

The expected yields in each bin of \ETg\ for all backgrounds in the horizontal and vertical signal regions after performing a combined fit to data in all the control samples, excluding data in the signal regions, are given in Tables~\ref{tab:yield_mask_horizontal} and~\ref{tab:yield_mask_vertical}, respectively.
The covariances between the predicted background yields across all the \ETg~bins in the two signal regions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:correlation_matrix}.
The expected yields together with the covariances can be used with the simplified likelihood
approach detailed in Ref.~\cite{CMS-NOTE-2017-001} to reinterpret the results for models not studied in this thesis

Figure~\ref{fig:limits} shows the 95\% \CL\ upper cross section limits with respect to the corresponding theoretical cross section ($\mu_{95}= \sigma_{95\%}/\sigma_{\text{theory}}$) for the  vector and axial-vector mediator scenarios, in the \mmed--\mdm\ plane. 
The solid black (dashed red) curves are the observed (expected) contours of $\mu_{95} = 1$. 
The $\sigma_{\text{theory}}$ hypothesis is excluded at 95\% \CL\ or above in the region with $\mu_{95} < 1$. 
The uncertainty in the expected upper limit includes the experimental uncertainties. 
For the simplified DM LO models considered, mediator masses up to 950\GeV are excluded for values of \mdm\ less than 1\GeV.
