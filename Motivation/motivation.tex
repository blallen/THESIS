\section{The Standard Model}
\label{sec:sm}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics describes the physical properties and dynamics of fermions, the fundamental constituents of matter, and their interactions in the language of a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory (QFT).
The Standard Model consists of a set of fermion fields, shown in Table~\ref{tab:fermions} and the local gauge symmetry group that acts on them
\begin{equation}
  G_{\text{SM}} = \suthree \times \sutwo \times \uone,
\end{equation}
which is composed of the subgroups
\begin{align}
  G_{\text{QCD}} & = \suthree \qquad \text{and} \\
  G_{\text{EWK}} & = \sutwo \times \uone,
\end{align}
corresponding to the \textit{strong} and \textit{electroweak} interactions, respectively.
Each fermion field exists in a unique representation of $G_{\text{SM}}$, also summarized in Table~\ref{tab:fermions}.
The possible represenations of \suthree\ are triplet, conjugate, and singlet, denoted by $\mathbf{3}$, $\mathbf{\bar{3}}$, and $\mathbf{1}$, respectively, while the possible representations of \sutwo\ are doublet and singlet, denoted by $\mathbf{2}$ and $\mathbf{1}$, respectively.
All fermions exist in the singlet representation of \uone, only distinguished by differing values of the weak hypercharge $Y$.
Conversely, all fermions in non-singlet representations of \suthree\ and \sutwo\ have the same interaction strength, a feature known as universality.

\label{tab:fermions}
\begin{tabular}{ l|c|c|c|c }
  Name & Symbol & $Y$ & \sutwo\ rep. & \suthree\ rep. \\
  \hline
  \hline
  Left-handed quark & $q_L$ & $\sfrac{1}{6}$ & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} \\
  Right-handed up-type quark & $u_R$ & $\sfrac{2}{3}$ & \textbf{1} & \textbf{3} \\
  Right-handed down-type quark & $d_R$ & $\sfrac{-1}{3}$ & \textbf{1} & \textbf{3} \\
  \hline
  Left-handed lepton & $\ell_L$ & $\sfrac{-1}{2}$ & \textbf{2} & \textbf{1} \\
  Right-handed charged lepton & $e_R$ & -1 & \textbf{1} & \textbf{1} \\
  Right-handed neutrino & $\nu_R$ & $\sfrac{1}{6}$ & \textbf{1} & \textbf{1} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For each category of fermion listed in Table~\ref{tab:fermions}, there exist three generations or copies in the Standard Model, identical except for differing masses.
The lepton electroweak doublets contain the left-handed charged leptons and neutrinos
\begin{equation}
  \ell_{L} = \begin{pmatrix} \nu_e \\ e^-_L \end{pmatrix} ,
              \begin{pmatrix} \nu_\mu \\ \mu^-_L \end{pmatrix} ,
              \begin{pmatrix} \nu_\tau \\ \tau^-_L \end{pmatrix} ,
\end{equation}
and the right-handed lepton singlets contain the right-handed projections of the same leptons and neutrinos.
The quark electroweak doublets contain the left-handed up-type and down-type quarks
\begin{equation}
  q_{L} = \begin{pmatrix} u_L \\ d_L \end{pmatrix} ,
           \begin{pmatrix} c_L \\ s_L \end{pmatrix} ,
           \begin{pmatrix} t_L \\ b_L \end{pmatrix} ,
\end{equation}
and the right-handed quark singlets contain the right-handed projections of the same quarks.
% where $d'$, $s'$, and $b'$ are the electroweak eigenstates of the down-type quarks (further explained in Section~\ref{subsec:ewk}).
Quarks also exist in a strong triplet, which will be denoted with a superscript $c$ as necessary.

\subsection{Strong Interactions}
\label{subsec:qcd}

The strong interactions of quarks and gluons are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), with the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:lqcd}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{QCD}} = i \bar q_f^a \slashed D^{ab} q_f^b + m_f \bar q_f^a q_f^a - \frac{1}{4} G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{a,\mu\nu} + \theta \frac{g_s^2}{72\pi^2} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} G^{c,\mu\nu} G^{c, \rho\sigma},
\end{equation}
where repeated indices are contracted.
The $q_f^a$ are the quark-field Dirac spinors of flavor $f \in \{u,d,c,s,t,b\}$, color $a \in \{r,g,b\}$ (he basis element of the triplet representation), and mass $m_f$.
The first term in Equation~\ref{eqn:lqcd} contains the QCD covariant derivative
\begin{equation}
  D_{\mu}^{ab} = \delta^{ab} \partial_\mu - i g_s \sum_{c} t_c^{ab} G_{c,\mu},
\end{equation}
where $g_s$ is the strong interaction coupling strength, $t_c$ are the eight $3\times3$ Hermitian traceless matrices that serve as the generators of the triplet representation of \suthree, and $G_c$ are the corresponding eight gluon fields.
The third term in Equation~\ref{eqn:lqcd} contains the gluon field strength tensors
\begin{equation}
  G_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu G_\nu^a - \partial_\nu G_\mu^a - g_s f^{abc} G_\mu^b G_\nu^C,
\end{equation}
where $f^{abc}$ are the structure constants of \suthree.
The non-Abelian structure of the \suthree\ group means allows for 3-gluon and 4-gluon interactions in addition to the quark-antiquark-gluon interactions.

The last term in Equation~\ref{eqn:lqcd} violates CP conservation and produces a non-zero electric dipole moment (EDM) for the neutron.
Experimental limits on the neutron EDM constraint the $\theta$ parameter to be smaller than $10^{-10}$.
The Peccei-Quinn theory provides a possible method to force $\theta$ to zero by introducing the hypothetical axion particle. The axion is a potential dark matter candidate and will be discussed further in Section~\ref{sec:dm}.

\subsection{Electroweak Interactions}
\label{subsec:ewk}

The electroweak interactions of fermions are described by $\sutwo \times \uone$ gauge group, with the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:lewk}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{EWK}} = i \bar \psi_i \slashed D \psi_i - \frac{1}{4} \vec W_{\mu\nu} \cdot \vec W^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where repeated indices are contracted and $\psi \supseteq \{q_L, u_R, d_R, \ell_L, e_R, \nu_R\}$ is the set of SM fermions, and the gauge field tensors are given by
\begin{align}
  B_{\mu\nu} & = \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu \qquad \text{and} \\
  \vec W_{\mu\nu} & = \partial_\mu \vec W_\nu - \partial_\nu \vec W_\mu + g \vec W^\mu \times \vec W^\nu ,
\end{align}
where $\vec W_\mu$ and $B_\mu$ are the gauge fields for \sutwo\ and \uone, respectively, and $g$ is the coupling strength for \sutwo.
The first term in Equation~\ref{eqn:lewk} contains the EWK covariant derivative
\begin{equation}
  D_{\mu} = \partial_\mu - i g \vec T \cdot \vec W_\mu - i g' Y B_\mu,
\end{equation}
where $g'$ is the coupling strength for \uone,
$Y$ is the \uone\ hypercharge of the fermion field,
and $\vec T$ are the generators of the doublet representation of \sutwo.
The generators can be written in terms of the Pauli spin matrices $\vec T = \vec \sigma / 2$ and only have non-zero action on left-handed particles.
% and $\delta_L$ is 1 if the fermion field is left-handed and 0 if it is right-handed.
The values of the hypercharge $Y$ shown in Table~\ref{tab:fermions} are chosen such that the physical electric charge of each fermion is given by $Q =  T_3 + Y$.

Notice that Equation~\ref{eqn:lewk} does not contain a Dirac mass term like that found in Equation~\ref{eqn:lqcd}.
This is because the term
\begin{equation}
  m \bar \psi \psi = m \left( \bar \psi_L \psi_R + \bar \psi_R \psi_L \right)
\end{equation}
mixes the left-handed and right-handed fermions leading to a Lagrangian that is no longer invariant under \sutwo.
As the observed fermions are not massless, the Lagrangian given in Equation~\ref{eqn:lewk} is incomplete and an additional mechanism needs to be introduced to produce non-zero fermion masses.

\subsection{Electroweak Symmetry Breaking}
\label{subsec:ewsb}

Spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking provides the mechanism we need, as well as providing masses to the weak gauge bosons. The \sutwo\ symmetry is broken by introducing a left-handed complex scalar doublet $\phi$ with $Y_\phi = \sfrac{1}{2}$ to the Lagrangian in the following manner
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:ewsb}
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{EWK}} \mapsto \mathcal{L}_{\text{EWK}} + \left|D_\mu \phi \right|^2 + \mu^2 \phi^2 - \lambda \left| \phi \right|^4 .
\end{equation}
We choose to write this complex doublet, known as the complex Higgs field, in terms of four real-valued fields so that
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \phi_1 + i \phi_2 \\ \phi_3 + i\phi_4 \end{pmatrix} .
\end{equation}
Fortunately, the two self-interaction terms create a Higgs potential with a degenerate global minimum at the vacuum expectation value (vev)
\begin{equation}
  v \equiv \langle | \phi | \rangle = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}},
\end{equation}
and through gauge rotations we set $\langle \phi_{1,2,4} \rangle = 0$, removing three degrees of freedom and producing three massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons.
The remaining degree of freedom is the real Higgs field $H$ which expresses small peturbations around the vev in the third component of the complex Higgs field $\phi_3 = v + H$.

The kinetic term in Equation~\ref{eqn:ewsb} couples the complex Higgs field to the EWK gauge bosons as follows at the vev
\begin{equation}
  \left| D_\mu \phi \right|^2 = \frac{v^2}{8} \left[ \left(g W_\mu^1 \right)^2 + \left(g W_\mu^2 \right)^2 + \left(g' B_\mu - g W_\mu^3 \right)^2 \right].
\end{equation}
Diagonalizing this term gives rise to the three massive weak bosons and the massless photon that we observe in nature:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{matrix}[l | l]
    W_\mu^{\pm} \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( W_\mu^1 \mp W_\mu^2 \right)
    & m_W = \frac{1}{2} vg \\
    Z_\mu \equiv \cos \thetaw W_\mu^3 - \sin \thetaw B_\mu
    & m_Z = \frac{1}{2} v \sqrt{g^2 + (g')^2} \\
    A_\mu \equiv \sin \thetaw W_\mu^3 + \cos \thetaw B_\mu
    & m_A = 0,
  \end{matrix}
\end{equation}
where $\tan \thetaw = g'/g$.

%% paragraph on L_EWK in terms of W, Z, and A. 

We can also expand Equation~\ref{eqn:ewsb} about the vev giving us the following Higgs Lagrangian
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}_H = \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu H \partial^\mu H & - \frac{1}{2} m_H^2 H^2 - \frac{1}{2} m_W^2 W_\mu^+ W^{-\mu} - \frac{1}{2} m_Z^2 Z_\mu Z^\mu \\
  & + \frac{m_H^2}{2 v} H^3 + \frac{2 m_W^2}{v} W_\mu^+ W^{-\mu} H + \frac{m_Z^2}{v} Z_\mu Z^\mu H \\
  & + \frac{m_H^2}{8 v^2} H^4 + \frac{m_W^2}{v^2} W_\mu^+ W^{-\mu} H^2 + \frac{m_Z^2}{2v^2} Z_\mu Z^\mu H^2, 
\end{align}
where $m_H = \mu \sqrt{2} $.
Thus, we see that the real Higgs field $H$ has trilinear and quartic couplings to itself and the weak gauge bosons with coupling strengths proportional to the mass squared of the appropriate boson.
This suggests a way to introduce fermion masses through the Higgs field.

\subsection{Fermion Masses}
\label{subsec:yukawa}

Introducing Yukawa couplings between the complex Higgs field $\phi$ and the SM fermion fields enables us to add mass terms for the fermions.
First, we start with the terms for charged leptons,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:lyuk}
  \mathcal{L}^{\text{leptons}}_{\text{Y}} = \bar \ell_L Y_e \phi e_R + \bar e_R Y_e \phi^\dagger \ell_L,
\end{equation}
where $Y_e$ is the Yukawa matrix for the charged leptons.
In general, Yukawa matrices and thus mass matrices are non-diagonal and hence we need to convert from the electroweak eigenstates $f_{L,R}$ to the mass eigenstates $\tilde{f}_{L,R} = U^{f}_{L,R} f_{L,R}$ where $U^{f}_{L,R}$ is a unitary matrix.
With this we rewrite Equation~\ref{eqn:lyuk} in terms of the mass eigenstates
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}^{\text{leptons}}_{\text{Y}} & = \bar{\tilde{\ell}}_{L} U^e_L Y_e \phi U^{e\dagger}_R \tilde{e}_{R} + \bar{\tilde{e}}_{R} U^e_R Y_e \phi^\dagger U^{e\dagger}_L \tilde{\ell}_{L} \\
  & = \bar{\tilde{\ell}}_{L} \tilde Y_e \phi \tilde{e}_{R} + \bar{\tilde{e}}_{R} \tilde Y_e^\dagger \phi^\dagger \tilde{\ell}_{L}, 
\end{align}
where $\tilde Y_e = U^e_L Y_e U^{e\dagger}_R$ is the diagonalized Yukawa matrix for the charged leptons.
After electroweak symmetry breaking, these terms become
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}^{\text{leptons}}_{\text{Y}} & = - \frac{v + H}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \bar{\tilde{e}}_L \tilde Y_e  \tilde{e}_R + \bar{\tilde{e}}_R \tilde Y_e^\dagger \tilde{e}_L \right) \\
  & = - \left(1 + \frac{H}{v}\right) \left( \bar{\tilde{e}}_L \tilde M_e \tilde{e}_R + \bar{\tilde{e}}_R \tilde M_e^\dagger \tilde{e}_L \right)\\
  & = - \tilde M_e \bar e e - \frac{\tilde M_e}{v} \bar e e H,
    \label{eqn:lmass}
\end{align}
where $\tilde M_e = v \tilde Y_e / \sqrt{2}$ is the diagonalized mass matrix for the charged leptons and $e$ is the set of massive Dirac spinors for the charged leptons.

From Equation~\ref{eqn:lmass}, we see that the Yukawa couplings between the complex Higgs field $\phi$ and the charged leptons result in a Dirac mass term and a coupling to the real Higgs field $H$ that is proportional to the mass of the charged leptons and the vev.
The same procedure is used to introduce mass terms for the down-type quarks whereas for the neutrinos and up-type quarks we must use the conjugate doublet $\phi_c = - i \sigma_2 \phi^*$ in place of $\phi$ to obtain the same result.
Note that for the charged leptons and up-type quarks, it is possible to define a basis of simultaneous electroweak and mass eigenstates, so in practice $\tilde Y_{e,u} = Y_{e,u}$ as $U^{e,u}_L = U^{e,u}_R = \mathit{\mathbf{I}}$.
However, it is not possible to do this for the neutrinos at the same time as the charged leptons or for the down-type quarks at the same time as the up-type quarks.
