A search is conducted for new physics in final states containing a photon and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV.
The data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns.
No deviations from the predictions of the standard model are observed. 
The results are interpreted in the context of dark matter production and limits on new physics parameters are calculated at 95\% confidence level. 
For the two simplified dark matter production models considered, the observed (expected) lower limits on the mediator masses are both 950\,(1150)\GeV for 1\GeV dark matter mass.
