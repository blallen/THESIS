A search is conducted for new physics in final states containing a photon and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV.
The data collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns.
The results are interpreted as exclusion limits on the various dark matter models, such as heavy vector mediators, dimension-7 contact operators, and Higgs-portal dark sectors.
Improved limits are set with respect to previous analyses using photon plus missing transverse momentum final states.
